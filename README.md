# Filler
Create your player to face other students on the famous (or not) plateau of the Filler.

###### As written from the subject:

###### Summary: Create your player program to compete against other students on the famous (or not) Filler board. The principle is simple: two players take on each other on a board, and take turns placing the piece that the master of the game (supplied in the form of a Ruby executable) gives them, earning points. The game stops as soon as a piece can no longer be placed. Little playful project!

###### Usage: ./filler_vm -p1 player.filler -p2 [your].player -f maps/map00
